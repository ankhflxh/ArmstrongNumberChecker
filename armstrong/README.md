Using Tkinter and Python, I created a Program to find 3-digit Armstrong number. It accepts a 3-digit number from user and check & confirms whether it is an Armstrong number or not and a roper message is displayed as the result.
Using Tkinter,I implemented a simple GUI that is attractive and has an input range between 100 - 999.
Note:
Armstrong number of 3 digits, the sum of cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself. 
For example:
153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3 = 1 + 125 + 27= 153
Hence 153 is an Armstrong number.
